The L in "Level III" in "Intended to conform to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines level AAA" should be capitalized. -- DONE

I think there's an extra space in C++26 in "Optionals for lvalue references are on track for C++ 26." -- DONE

All four bullets on the "Why so long?" slide are questions and should end with question marks, not periods (as 3 of the 4 currently do). -- DONE

Remove the comma after "extra" in "A non-owning type with reference semantics with one additional, empty, value." -- Changed

On the "Monadic Operations" slide, there seems to be an extra blank line at the end of the code block. The bottom of the black box should be closer to the last line of code. -- FIXED

The 2005 paper has "an" in the title, when it should be 'a' (as all the other papers are correctly titled): "2005: N1878: A Proposal to Add an Utility Class to Represent Optional Objects (Revision 1)" [This re-appears in the Bibliography, so fix there too!] -- It's broken in the biblographic data that WG21 publishes. I'll fix the main slide, the generated Bibliography will take a litttle more work.

The 2016 paper (P0220R0) should have 'TS' in CAPS and so should C++ (not c++); the second error needs to fixed in the title of the 2018 paper (P1175R0) as well. [This re-appears in the Bibliography, so fix there too!]  -- fixed in main slde, will work on editing the bib data.

Is there a word or two missing in "The vector<bool> problem [MISSING?] only for an entire value category. -- the "vector<bool> problem" is a well known issue
Analogy: "The designated hitter problem only for all baseball players on the team."
Adding quotes around the phase.

Missing comma in "At the time of C++14, they couldn't quite be constexpr." AND "Placement new had issues, as did union techniques. Also, is "Placement new" correct or is there something missing there too? - "Placement new" is a term of art in C++.  Italicized the technical term.

MISSING WORD: make_optional() was largely supplanted by CTAD. -- fixed

MISSING WORDS: is_trivial will be deprecated in C++26. --fixed

MISSING PERIOD AFTER VS: Shallow vs. Deep const -- fixed

MISSING COMMAS: "However, lack of explicit makes the type exponentially more complex, as there are more interactions between member functions." --fixed

MISSING ?: "What is the "value type" for an optional?" --fixed

Should this be 'overloaded'? -> Large overload sets are difficult to reason about.
-- overload set is a technical term. Setting in italics.

MISSING WORD(S)?? -> "Delete, rather than remove via concept, [MISSING??] overloads that produce dangling references."
-- Delete, rather than remove via ~concept~,  function overloads that produce dangling references.

Should this be "assignments"? -> "All assignment through the single function."
-- All assignments are through the single function.

Remove extra space in C++Now: "Began last year at C++Now 2024" -- fixed

MISSING COMMA (depending on your intent): Unfortunately, used early-Modern CMake.
--
Unfortunately ~smd::optional~ used early-Modern CMake.

This meant rework to bring it to current standards.

Bibliography seems to be missing some authors' names... ___
--
Chicago style, repeated author names are ___
I'll hide the slide in the presentation. And fiddle with the bibliography software last thing.
--
Copyright statement on the slide template is wrong. Should be: Â© 2025 Bloomberg Finance L.P. All rights reserved. -- Fixed
