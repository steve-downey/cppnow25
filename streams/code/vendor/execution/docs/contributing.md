# Contributing to `beman::execution`

We welcome all constructive contributions! You will have something you
can contribute independent of your level expertise!

There is a huge range of contributions needed and welcome! Here is an
incomplete list of starting points for contributions:

* Some documentation is unclear.
* There is some bug somewhere. That can be a typo in some documentation,
   a logic error in the implementation, a deviation from the standard
   specification, etc.
* Something reference moved or the reference is out of date.
* When compiling the code on your system warnings or even errors are
    created.
* The [issues page](https://github.com/bemanproject/execution/issues) lists
    known issues.
* The implememtation of a component may be missing.
* The layout of some pages related to the project can be improved.
* Some behaviour of a component isn't tested or documented.
* You found something which should be linked from the
    [resources](https://github.com/bemanproject/execution/blob/main/docs/contributing.md) page.
* There are [pull requests](https://github.com/bemanproject/execution/pulls)
    which could be reviewed.
* This very page or list is lacking something.

Whatever it is, you can improve the project! Ideally, create a pull
request with your proposed change. If you think you can't do that
for whatever reason, create an issue (if possible checking if the
issue isn't reported, yet) explaining what should be done. You can
possibly use a pull request or an issue to ask for help with something
you want to contribute. You can also send a message to one of the
contributors with your suggestion, e.g. to
[Dietmar KÃ¼hl](mailto:dietmar.kuehl@me.com).
